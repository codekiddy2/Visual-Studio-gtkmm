**About Visual-Studio-gtkmm:**

Visual Studio 2015 projects to compile GTK+, GTKMM, ICU, Crypto++, Boost and all it's dependencies.

More information such as dependency graphs and how to use these projects
can be found on here on [wiki](https://github.com/codekiddy2/Visual-Studio-gtkmm/wiki)

There are also experimental pre-built binaries for VS 2013 and VS 2015 in release [section](https://github.com/codekiddy2/Visual-Studio-gtkmm/releases).
Here is an image of my result, creating a new gtkmm 3 project in Visual Studio 2013/2015

**More C\C++ libraries**

The aim of Visual-Studio-gtkmm is to provide a user friendly build system to compile / build latest gtkmm
and all it's dependencies soley by using latest Visual Studio.

This aim has been expanded to provide projects and solutions to build all possible dependencies, both optional
and required ones as well as non-required libraries such as Crypto++, boost, icu, and many others
as well as project templates for Visual Studio including GTK+, gtkmm, crypto++ and boost.

So that all you have to do is click on

* File > New > Project

and start coding with latest libraries without too much overhead.
Here is another example image showing that building latest gtkmm with Visual Studio is easy:
