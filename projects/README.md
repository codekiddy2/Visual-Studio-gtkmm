Here you will find Visual Studio 2013/2015 projects for individual packages.
All of the projects share exactly the same settings found in properties folder.
See wiki -> properties for more information.

Some projects override these global settings for specific needs but this is reduced to minimum.
These projects will fail to load if properties folder containing properties
is not placed next to projects folder.
