First make sure you've prepared MSYS2 environment by reading the
"MSYS2-prepare.md" found in readme folder

update contents of config files to reflect your build and package versions
run bat file from VS cmd prompt (x64 or x86 cmd prompt depending on build type)

cd into this (root) directory:
>cd D:\Github\Visual-Studio-gtkmm\projects\compile-icons
>debug-64

from within MSYS2 shell cd into root directory:
>cd "D:\Github\Visual-Studio-gtkmm\projects\compile-icons"

run sh file from MSYS2:
>./debug-64.sh
